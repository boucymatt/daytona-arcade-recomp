# Daytona USA static recompilation

Daytona USA (Sega Model 2) rebuilt as native code: the game's i960 program
and the TGP program it uploads are statically recompiled to portable C++,
and the fixed-function hardware (geometrizer, rasterizer, tilemaps) is native
C++. No interpreter, no emulation core. MAME is used only as a test oracle.
See `docs/daytona-usa-recomp-design.md` and `HANDOFF.md`.

No game data is in this repository. You need your own ROM set (a
MAME-format `.zip` or `.7z`): `daytona93` (Daytona USA Deluxe '93) or
`daytona` (Revision A, 1994), or both.

## Platforms

| Platform | Status | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows, macOS, Linux | The main build; setup below | [docs/getting-started.md](docs/getting-started.md) |
| Android | Works (arm64), with on-screen touch controls or a Bluetooth or USB controller; tested on a device | [platform/mobile](platform/mobile/README.md) |
| iOS | Works on iPhone, installed through Xcode or AltStore, with touch controls or a controller; tested on a device | [platform/mobile](platform/mobile/README.md) |
| PS Vita | Works: a native Vita app (SDL2); tested on a Vita | [platform/vita](platform/vita/README.md) |
| Dreamcast | Runs in the Flycast emulator with sound and the controller, about 32 frames/s (the arcade runs 57.52); not yet on a console; in progress | [platform/dreamcast](platform/dreamcast/README.md) |

Every port starts from the desktop setup: the game code is generated on a
desktop computer from your ROM set, then built for the other platform.

## Setup

**New here? Follow [docs/getting-started.md](docs/getting-started.md)**: step
by step for Windows, macOS and Linux, with fixes for the usual problems.

In short:

1. Copy your ROM set into `roms/` in the project folder, named exactly after
   the set: `roms/daytona93.zip` (Daytona USA Deluxe '93) and/or
   `roms/daytona.zip` (Revision A, 1994), or `.7z`. Each is built as its own
   game; other Daytona sets are rejected.
2. Run setup. Linux or macOS:

       ./setup.sh

   Windows (PowerShell):

       powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File setup.ps1

   On Windows the game is built with Clang from the Visual Studio Build
   Tools. Setup installs them, or adds the Clang tools to the Visual Studio
   you have; Windows asks for permission for that. `setup.ps1 --msvc` uses
   Microsoft's compiler instead.
3. Run the command setup prints at the end (`build/daytona`, or
   `build\Release\daytona.exe` on Windows).

**Updating:** `git pull`, then run setup again (it recompiles the game from
your ROM set, since updates can change the generated code).

**Clean rebuild** (after a failed build, or to start over): delete the
`build` folder and run setup again. Your ROM set in `roms/` and the
downloaded libraries in `extern/` are kept.

If setup fails, it says whether your ROM set was rejected (the line above
names the file) or the build failed (the errors are just above). The
[guide's troubleshooting](docs/getting-started.md#troubleshooting) covers
the usual ones. Every change is built and tested by GitHub Actions on
Windows (Clang and MSVC), macOS and Linux (GCC and Clang), without a ROM set.

Setup scripts install the toolchain (C++20 compiler, CMake, Ninja, Python 3, Git;
Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools on Windows, Homebrew packages on macOS, your
distribution's packages on Linux), fetch the pinned dependencies into
`extern/`, build, and run the tests. Put your ROM set at
`roms/daytona93.zip` (or `.7z`) first and the game code is recompiled as well (into
`build/`, never committed); Revision A at `roms/daytona.zip` is recompiled
into `build-daytona/`. Already have a toolchain? Run
`python3 scripts/setup.py` directly.

Options: `--msvc` (setup.ps1 only: Microsoft's compiler), `--test-extras`
(optional test dependencies), `--with-mame` (MAME source for the oracle
test), `--build-mame` (the patched MAME that records validation traces;
Linux and macOS).

After changing the recompiler or the seeds: `python3 scripts/recompile.py`
(and `python3 scripts/recompile.py --set daytona --build-dir build-daytona`
for Revision A). Revision A is `build-daytona/daytona`, with its own
settings and saves. Its factory settings are a linked twin cabinet, which
waits for a second cabinet: set a single cabinet once in test mode (F2).

## Link play (the 1994 set)

Revision A (`daytona`) can link two or more cabinets over a network, Wi-Fi
or wired, as linked arcade machines race each other (experimental). On each
computer, in the launcher's Game tab, tick **Link to other cabinets**, give
this cabinet's port and the next cabinet's `host:port` (the cabinets form a
ring; with two, each one's next is the other), then in test mode (F2) >
GAME SYSTEM set **LINK ID** (one MASTER, the others SLAVE) and a different
**CAR NUMBER** on each. Two on one computer: start the second with
`--profile 2` (its own settings and saves) and give the two different ports,
e.g. 15112 and 15113, each the other's as next.

## Handheld frontends

- [PS Vita](platform/vita/README.md): native frontend and audio options.
- [PSP-1000](platform/psp/README.md): experimental 32 MB port, native threaded
  audio and Memory Stick-backed ROM caches. Hardware performance is not yet
  verified; this is not a smooth-gameplay release.

## Playing

    build/daytona

(`build/Release/daytona.exe` with the Visual Studio generator.) The launcher
opens first:

- **Game**: choose your `daytona93` ROM set, `.zip` or `.7z` (Browse, or type the path); every file
  is checked against the ROM set this build was recompiled from. Graphics API
  (automatic, Vulkan, Direct3D 12, Metal), Renderer (software, the exact
  CPU renderer; or hardware, on the GPU, experimental), Super sampling
  (hardware renderer: off, or the 3D drawn at 2x to 4x the original resolution), fullscreen, hide the
  mouse cursor in game (it shows again in the launcher), the
  fullscreen mode (borderless, or an exclusive resolution and refresh rate),
  frame pacing (all off: the arcade's own speed on any display; smooth
  pacing on a 57.52 Hz display, sync to display, VRR pacing), Draw mode (double buffered,
  as the game; single buffered or every third frame draw less often, for slower
  machines; the game itself runs at full speed), Skip launcher (start
  the game straight away next time; Esc still opens the launcher), and Hold
  Test button (opens the game's test menu without an F2 key, as on mobile). Enhancements
  (off by default): widescreen 16:10, 16:9 or 21:9, which shows more of the
  scene at the sides with the HUD kept 4:3 in the centre, or with "HUD at
  the screen edges" (experimental) the lap times, position, condition panel and course map
  moved out to the sides (in a race the sky at the sides is plain blue, or
  with "Stretch tile background" the game's sky picture stretched across);
  and
  a draw distance slider for the scenery (default
  is the game's own; shorter runs faster). Start.
- **Controls**: bind every arcade control to a key, a gamepad button or
  axis, and a wheel or joystick input (experimental; click, then press). Triggers, sticks,
  wheels and pedals are analogue. Wheels, pedals and shifters work as
  separate devices too; binding a wheel or pedal axis also sets its range
  (turn or press as far as full lock or full travel should be, and let go).
  Force feedback (experimental): the arcade wheel's motor (centring,
  resistance, the wheel being pushed) plays on the device steering is bound
  to, a force feedback wheel, or a gamepad's rumble when the car is pushed,
  with a strength slider and an optional log. Live meters, dead zones, invert
  steering, and Legacy Logitech wheel support (Linux and macOS; on by default
  on Linux) for older Logitech wheels such as the original Driving Force.
- **Audio**: volume and mute, separate Music and Effects volumes (both 100%:
  the arcade's own mix), and native audio (experimental).

In the game, Esc brings the launcher back (Resume, Reset, Quit). Settings
are saved as they change, with the settings EEPROM and backup RAM, in your
user data folder (`launcher.ini`). Options: `--rom FILE.zip --autostart
--gpu vulkan|direct3d12|metal --fullscreen --audio native|reference
--profile NAME` (a separate settings and saves folder).

Default controls:

| Control | Keyboard | Gamepad |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Steer | Left / Right | Left stick (analogue) |
| Accelerate / brake | Up / Down | Right / left trigger (analogue) |
| Gears 1-4 | 1 2 3 4 | |
| View buttons VR1-VR4 | A S D F | Face buttons |
| Shift up / down | W / Q | Right / left shoulder |
| Coin / start | 5 / Enter | Back / Start |
| Test / service | F2 / F3 | |
| Fullscreen / launcher | F11 / Esc | |

Sound: the sound board's 68000 program is statically recompiled like the
i960 code and runs on the native board with the YM3438 (ymfm) and both
MultiPCMs; output goes through SDL audio. Volume, mute, and separate music
and effects volumes are on the launcher's Audio tab.
